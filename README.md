Project of Walmart Sales: 
In this project, we want to study how weather affects the sales of certain products at Walmart stores. We have three main sets of data: sales data, weather data, and a key that links each store to a weather station. The data covers daily observations from January 2012 to October 2014. We will use data from 2012-2013 for training and 2014 for testing.
To do this project, we first combine and clean the data, making sure everything is in the right format and filling in any gaps. We then explore the data to see if there are any noticeable patterns between the weather and sales.
After that, we create additional information (features) based on the existing data, such as the day of the week, month, and temperature. These new features will help our model better understand the relationship between weather and sales.
Finally, we build a machine learning model to predict sales based on weather data. We train the model using the data from 2012-2013 and test its accuracy using the data from 2014.


 I applied a clustering algorithm on weather data to group weather stations based on similarities in their weather patterns. By identifying similarities within clusters and differences between them, I was able to better understand the relationship between weather and product sales.
I used a suitable clustering algorithm, such as K-means or Gaussian Mixture Models, to group the weather stations. After determining the optimal number of clusters, I analyzed the weather features within each cluster and compared them to identify any trends or patterns. This helped me understand the similarities within the clusters and the differences between them.
To visually demonstrate the similarities among the clusters, I created plots or maps that displayed the weather stations and their respective clusters. Using color coding or symbols for each cluster, the visualization highlighted the similarities among weather stations within the same cluster, such as temperature patterns, precipitation levels, or humidity.
This clustering approach provided valuable insights into how different weather patterns can impact product sales at various Walmart locations. The results of the project could be further utilized to optimize inventory management, forecast sales, and improve overall business strategies.
