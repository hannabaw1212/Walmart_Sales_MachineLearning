# Walmart_Sales_MachineLearning
Project of Walmart Sales:
In this project, we want to study how weather affects the sales of certain products at Walmart stores. We have three main sets of data: sales data, weather data, and a key that links each store to a weather station. The data covers daily observations from January 2012 to October 2014. We will use data from 2012-2013 for training and 2014 for testing.
To do this project, we first combine and clean the data, making sure everything is in the right format and filling in any gaps. We then explore the data to see if there are any noticeable patterns between the weather and sales.
After that, we create additional information (features) based on the existing data, such as the day of the week, month, and temperature. These new features will help our model better understand the relationship between weather and sales.
Finally, we build a machine learning model to predict sales based on weather data. We train the model using the data from 2012-2013 and test its accuracy using the data from 2014.
